*Care is given to ensuring the design and implementation provide a consistent and expected experience.*

Modern products are never described as flaky, unreliable, or broken. They are designed to be reliable, safe, and secure. Users get a sense that the product they are using was carefully crafted for the exact purpose it was made. The best teams do this with flair and delight customers with additional reassurance that the product designers understood them at the deepest levels, and thus form a strong trust reserved for world-leading products.
