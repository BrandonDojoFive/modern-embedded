*Project goals and requirements clearly defined, documented, and prioritized with traceability through verification and validation.*

Modern firmware teams have moved beyond waterfall requirements gathering and have moved into hybridized styles of operating. These systems acknowledge that while some aspects of product development must be planned up front, the best products are designing in an environment where learning and iteration are the primary goals.

Business level goals are clearly communicated to all on the team, documented to all developers and stakeholders, and referenced often.

Success at the task, story, epic, and product level is defined through automated or manual verification and validation, traceable back to product requirements. Every feature that goes into the product is clearly traceable back to a product requirement.
