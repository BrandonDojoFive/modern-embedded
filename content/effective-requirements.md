*Project goals and requirements clearly defined, documented, and prioritized with traceability through verification and validation.*

Modern firmware teams have moved beyond the upfront planning of waterfall requirements gathering. Instead, their primary goal is learning and iteration.

Business level goals are communicated to all on the team, documented for developers and stakeholders, and referenced often.

Automated or manual verification and validation define success at the task, story, epic, and product level. Every feature that goes into the product is traceable to a product requirement.
