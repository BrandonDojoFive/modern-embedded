*Exactly the same environment for all builds, fast and verifiable.*

Your build environment consists of the compiler, the linker, and additional build scripts and build tools - everything that is required from when you start your build to when you produce a final, tested, releasable binary.

These build environments are managed, traceable, and quickly stood up through container technologies. A managed build environment has multiple benefits:
- Developer onboarding is fast and painless
- Bugs due to differing environments are eliminated
- Upgrades to tools are controlled and fast
- Production CI releases are painless since they utilize the same environment developers use every day
