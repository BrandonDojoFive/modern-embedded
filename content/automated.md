*Automated pipelines for all development activities, allowing rapid, repeatable, and reliable progress.*

Humans are not good at doing tedious tasks reliably. Computers do tedious tasks exceptionally reliably. Use humans for the creative parts of coding, and use computers for the tedious parts.

Automation is an investment that is well worth it. Modern teams invest time in build scripts, automated tests, one-step builds, quick debug and helper scripts, all of which contribute to quickly removing the tedium and optimizing for the creative.
