*Automated pipelines for all development activities, allowing rapid, repeatable, and reliable progress.*

Humans are not good at doing tedious tasks reliably. Computers are exceptional at doing tedious tasks. So use humans for the creative parts of coding and computers for the boring details.

Automation is a worthwhile investment. Modern teams invest time in build scripts, automated tests, one-step builds, and debug and helper scripts - all of which reduce tedium and optimize for the creative.
