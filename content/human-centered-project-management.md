*Expectations and risk management processes that value humans and their interactions as key to innovation.*

Modern teams avoid traps of past software development, such as:
- Mandatory overtime to meet deadlines, aka death marches
- Unrealistic internal or external expectations
- Failure to understand and manage risks

They do this by:
- Communicating expecatations clearly, and reviewing them often
- Always having clear work direction in a groomed backlog
- Transparent communication amongst the team and with stakeholders
- Operating at a sustainable pace, never "pushing hard" to meet a deadline
- Giving creative thinkers the autonomy and safety to innovate

Modern teams also acknowledge and embrace the human aspect of developing a product. It should be fun. It should be interactive. There should be compromises. There may be surprises or unexpected issues. These are all expected, managed, planned for, with pride in the work result as the ultimate outcome.
